        My work is mainly focused on third-dimension modeling, texturing and
        rendering. I like exploring the creatures with a touch of dark
        surrealism for characters and production. Now I’m an interactive media
        design student in Istanbul ⏤ currently freelancing and seeking
        internship opportunities.
